ðŸ“Š Statistics and Data Analysis Practicals

Welcome to my repository dedicated to Statistics and Data Analysis!
This space showcases my practical exercises, lab assignments, and projects from my coursework â€” where I explored real-world data using core statistical methods and analytical tools.

ðŸ“˜ Overview

Each folder in this repository represents a separate practical session, covering different statistical techniques and their implementation in Python. Every project emphasizes understanding statistical theory through hands-on experimentation and visualization.

ðŸ§© Topics Covered

Across these practicals, Iâ€™ve worked with a broad range of statistical and analytical methods, including:

Descriptive & Inferential Analysis

Probability and Sampling Distributions

Data Visualization (bar charts, histograms, box plots, scatter plots)

Hypothesis Testing (Z-test, t-test, ANOVA, Chi-Square)

Correlation & Linear Regression

Confidence Intervals and Variability Measures

ðŸ§° Tools and Technologies

All analyses were conducted in Python, utilizing industry-standard libraries for computation and visualization:

pandas â†’ data handling and preprocessing

numpy â†’ mathematical and statistical operations

matplotlib & seaborn â†’ creating insightful visualizations

scipy â†’ advanced statistical calculations

scikit-learn â†’ regression modeling and predictive analysis

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The main goal of these practicals is to strengthen understanding of statistical reasoning and data-driven insights through coding, visualization, and interpretation.
